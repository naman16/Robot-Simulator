This is a robot simulator in which robot behavior is visualized within a graphics window. The robots are modeled after Braitenberg Vehicles, which use simple design to realize complex behavior. The environment has multiple robots, as well as stimuli such as lights and food. Robots exhibit different behavior in reaction to these stimuli, depending on their sensor-motor connections related to that stimulus. For example, some robots are attracted to the light and some fear the light. And the relationship to food changes over time as the robot gets hungrier. Strategy pattern has been used to implement robot motion and Observer Pattern has been used to implement the robot-stimuli interactions. The environment is configured through the GUI elements to increase the user-friendliness and give more control to the users.
